# About
Hey there, I created this repo with the sole purpose of providing a **completely buildable** version of the source code, that is completely **void** of any compile errors, although there are some warnings but I have tested the game to a pretty fair extend and no anomalies occur.

The Intended use of this repo is to provide people the ability to mod the game as they wish, and is not intended for **piracy** as the repo itself does not contain any game files, I hope that **someone** will find a good use for this!

Happy Modding,
**Nomadwithoutahome**


# Requirements

 1. Net Framework 3.5 (  **Dev Pack** )
 2. Latest version of HPAW (  **1.1.6** )
 3. Coffee ( **Black** )

# Credits
All rights and credits goto the original devolpers of the game [Daylight Studios](https://www.day-lightstudios.com)

>Note: These files are untouched/unmodified in anyway aside from correcting compiler errors

>Note: These files come from the **STEAM** version of the game, any other version is **NOT TESTED** as such i have no idea if  it will work, although i am sure it will but just as a precaution i put this in here.
