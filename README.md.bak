# About
Hey there, I created this repo with the sole purpose of providing a **completely buildable** version of the source code, that is completely **void** of any compile errors, although there are some warnings but I have tested the game to a pretty fair extend and no anomalies occur.

The Intended use of this repo is to provide people the ability to mod the game as they wish, and is not intended for **piracy** as the repo itself does not contain any game files, I hope that **someone** will find a good use for this!

Happy Modding,
**Nomadwithoutahome**

 2. Latest version of HPAW (  **1.1.5** ) or **GOG** version (**1.1.4.1**)
